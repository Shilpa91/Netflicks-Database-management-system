# Netflicks-Database-management-system

This project consists of a data management solution to host a netflix-like (netflicks) database to store content generation and consumption.

On the generation side, we store the artist, role, content, etc.

On the consumption side, we store the user, subscription, genre, etc.

For more details, please refer to the project document or the slide deck within the repo.
